### Binary Heap [link](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Binary%20Heaps/heaps.html)

A binary heap is a **complete binary** tree which satisfies the **heap property**.

The min-heap property: the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its parent, with the minimum-value element at the root.

Since a heap is a complete binary tree, it has a smallest possible height - a heap with N nodes always has O(log N) height.
